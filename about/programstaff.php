            <h2>Sport Club Program Staff</h2>
            <p>In providing leisure services to the Texas Tech community, the Sport Club Student Directors work under the cooperation of the Assistant Director of Sport Clubs by providing supervision to the sport clubs of Texas Tech University. Sport Clubs Student Directors are leaders within the program who demonstrate dependability, accountability, and initiative.</p>
            <p>Student Directors are enthusiastic to provide participants the most positive, yet enjoyable experience possible. Among their general responsibilities are supervising home events, responding to injured participants and managing risk management documents. Current American Red Cross CPR/AED certification is required, however, we provide both certifications after hiring. Hiring occurs at the end of each semester. Varied hours, usually evenings, weekends and a few office hours during the week.</p>
            <p>Sport Club Student Directors also lead portions of our program that range from travel and risk management to community service and fundraising. You can see each student's set of responsibilities as outlined in their titles below. If you are interested in being a Student Director for Sport Clubs, please contact <a href="mailto:recsports@ttu.edu">recsports@ttu.edu</a>.</p>
