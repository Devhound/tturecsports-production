            <h2>2018 Faculty/Staff Fitness Challenge</h2>

            <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p>The purpose of the Texas Tech Faculty & Staff Fitness Challenge is to support, motivate, inform, and encourage our campus community to be active, eat well, and be fit.</p>

            <p>Challenge Starts: January 22 </p>

            <h3>Create a team</h3>
            <p>Official team members must be full time, part time and graduate student TTU employees who are benefits eligible. Your teammates do not have to be in your department. Sorry, undergraduate student assistants are not eligible to participate. Get your team of 2 - 6 TTU employees together. Choose a captain. Team will register in 1 of 3 participation levels depending on their fitness goals:</p>
            <p><b>PLEASE NOTE - WE HAVE A NEW ONLINE SYSTEM, SO YOU WILL NEED TO CREATE A NEW USER ACCOUNT!</b></p>

            <h3>What Activities Can Be Counted?</h3>
            <p>The purpose of this program is to increase your daily activity level. This should be intentional and outside the scope of your normal activity. Walking to the restroom or to another office should not be counted; walking for 15 minutes of your lunchtime should be counted. Activity should be done at least at a moderate level. A simple way of determining this is the talk test—you should be able to talk in short bouts but not able to carry on a casual conversation or sing. <a href="AFChallenge/How To Participate and Log Your Minutes.pdf" class="pdf">Review this PDF for more explanation. </a></p>


            <h3>Find your support</h3>
            <p>Join the TTU Challenge Facebook Group! This is a closed group on Facebook only for participants! <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1650039971915583/">Click here</a> to add yourself to the group.</p>
            <p>By joining the TTU Faculty & Staff Fitness Challenge you will have the support and encouragement of your team while you participate in physical activity. Individuals report minutes of activity separately but the team must meet the weekly goal to be eligible for weekly rewards. Teams will compete for rewards and build TTU Community spirit! The most creative name will also win a reward.</p>

            <h3>Team Goals</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>To enjoy physical actvity and healthy food choices with co-workers or by yourself.</li>

                <li>To record your progress in your minutes log.</li>

                <li>To encourage others to lead a balanced life, have fun and "Strive For Honor" in reporting minutes accurately.</li>
            </ul>
